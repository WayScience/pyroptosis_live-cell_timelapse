# Image profiling of live-cell timelapse data inducing pyroptosis

This repo contains code that processes and performs image-based profiling on single-cells in live-cell timelapse imaging data of pyroptosis in SH-SY5Y cells.

## Data
We have collected multiple datasets:
### Wave 1:
This wave 1 data is preliminary and generated to identify the best conditions for imaging pyroptosis in SH-SY5Y cells.
More specifics about Wave 1 data can be found in the [Wave1_data/README.md](Wave1_data/README.md).

### Wave 2:
This wave 2 data is generated using an Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell line, which is more relevant to the disease context of pyroptosis.
More specifics about Wave 2 data can be found in the [Wave2_data/README.md](Wave2_data/README.md).
