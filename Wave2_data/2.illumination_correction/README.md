# Illumination Correction
This module is used to perform illumination correction on all microscopy images.
This is done by using Cellprofiler.

## Calling the Cellprofiler pipeline
To run the Cellprofiler pipeline, we use the `cellprofiler` command in the terminal. The command is as follows:
```
bash run_ic_locally.sh
```
